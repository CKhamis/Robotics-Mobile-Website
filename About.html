    	    <p>Since 2001, Team 668: The Apes of Wrath has worked to inspire those in and around our community to identify the need for, and take part in, the education of science, technology, engineering and math.
    
    We strive to do this through our participation in FIRST Robotics, a multi-national organization that creates robotics programs for a variety of different student levels.
    
    Team 668 proudly participates in the FIRST Robotics Competition, or FRC. The team has participated in the FIRST Tech Challenge, or FTC program as well. 668 students also mentor FIRST Lego League, or FLL teams.
    
    The Apes of Wrath are open to any and all new members. If you, or someone you know in our area does not have access to a team, contact us.</p>
